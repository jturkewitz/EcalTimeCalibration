# Names of Developers with write access to this module
#
# There are two types of developers:
# 1) Administrators - entitled to edit all files in the module ,
#    in particular the .admin directory.  (Including this file) 
# 2) Regular Developers - entitled to edit all files in the module
#    except those in the .admin directory.
#
# Entries must have the following format:
#
#      [logname] : [Firstname Familyname] : [emailaddress]
#
#      where [logname] is the login name of the user (in lower case)
#            [Firstname Familyname] is the fullname of the user in free format
#            [emailaddress] any email address of the user
#
#      IMPORTANT: The only entry that uniqely identifies the user
#                 is the [loginname]. The rest of the entries are
#                 used for information and clarity purposes.
#
# You can find the information required to add a user, using the "phone"
# command from any CERN machine. "phone user -A" will give you a list of his
# accounts and lognames too.
# A safe assumption is to look for his ZH account on AFS/LXPLUS
# Please remember to use lower case for the logname.
# In case of doubts, please contact cvsadmin.cern.ch
